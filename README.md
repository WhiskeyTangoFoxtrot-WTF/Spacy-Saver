# Spacy-Saver
Tired of always saving files every time this progarm is for u!!
 Simple as hell: 
 1- Choose backup folder
 2-Choose Source Folder
 Finish!
 There is autorun button for whenever you need to code smth and want it to save it also in the backup or idk
 Note: If it says it is not responding it means that is doing backup or auto run backup you can check the folder and you will se the new files. 
 After it finished it will send a notifcations :)
 Pls give us credits :)
Some files may not be saved due of lack of permissions.
Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your needs. If you're planning to create a video or post about this, we'd appreciate it if you gave credit to this group.
